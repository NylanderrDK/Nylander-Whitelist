# Nylander-Whitelist
A standalone whitelist-system for FiveM, communicating with a database.

## Installation
1. Download the resource
2. Extract the files
3. Ensure/start the resource in your `.cfg` file
4. Configure `config.lua` to your liking
5. Import the SQL file into your database
6. Start the server

## Adding users to the whitelist
Currently, the only way to add users to the whitelist is through the database.<br>
I will soon be updating the resource, so you can add and remove users ingame.<br>
With a basic understanding of a database, you should be able to add a user within a few seconds.<br><br>

The resource automatically adds the user to the database when they join, and the only thing you need to do, is to change the `whitelisted` value besides their FiveM license to `1`. If you need any support, feel free to create an issue or contact me on Discord.
